            <h2>My story</h2>
            <p>I am a UI Designer who is passionate about identifying and solving problems, creating accessible, user-centered and aesthetically pleasing designs. Besides finding the best solutions to problems, I also have a passion for joining simplicity, functionality, usefulness, adding value and creating visually appealing elements, which is what made me fall in love with UI design since I find the combination of all those aspects in it. I have a background in office administrative assistance and ESL teaching, where solving various problems, giving and applying feedback, building rapport and communicating effectively were a big part of both roles on a daily basis. In my past positions, I provided customer and administration support by putting customers first, empathizing and really understanding their needs as was the case during my time as a teacher where I tailored lessons, approaches and methodologies to suit and support individual student needs. I believe my background gave me extremely valuable experience and skills that translated really well into User Interface and User Experience Design, as throughout all of my projects understanding and putting usersâ€™ needs first and at the center, being solution-oriented, applying feedback and always being concerned with simplicity, functionality, value, and whether the main objective was met came naturally to me. I am looking for a position in a company that is focused on solving problems effectively as its core mission and offers a safe, respectful, fun and diverse environment and values its team.</p>
